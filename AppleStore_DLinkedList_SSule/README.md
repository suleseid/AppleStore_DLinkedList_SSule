## Apple Store - Device Management System

```csharp
Hi everyone, my name is Suleman Seid. Thank you for giving me 
this chance to explain my project. 
I'm so excited to explain my project because this is 
my first interview presentation.

## Project name is Apple Store Doubly Linked List**
 
````
## Give a Brief Summary:

```csharp
   As a software developer, I undertook a project to create a specialized 
   device management system designed specifically for Apple stores. 
   Using my expertise in C# programming language because it is a generic,
   object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming.
   
   This project implements a device management system for an Apple Store using a 
   doubly linked list data structure. 

   The system allows the store to manage its inventory of electronic devices
   efficiently. 
   Each device in the store, such as iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks, is represented 
   as an object of the Devices<T> class.

   The project's main classes include Devices<T> representing individual devices 
   and DoublyLinkedList for managing the devices. 
  
## Devices<T> Class
   Represents an electronic device with properties such as Model, Storage, 
    Color, Price, ID, Year, and InStore status.
   Providing a constructor to initialize device properties and methods for validation.
   Implements the ToString() method to convert device information to a string format.

## DoublyLinkedList Class
   Implements a doubly linked list to manage devices.
   Providing methods to add, remove, search for, print, merge sort, insert after, 
   insert before, and clear the list.

   My contributions involved designing and implementing these classes, 
   error handling, algorithm implementation, testing, and documentation. 

   I built the system to efficiently handle the unique challenges associated 
   with managing Apple products in a retail setting. 

   My role involved designing and implementing essential components of the system, 
   such as the Devices<T> class for representing individual devices and 
   the DoublyLinkedList data structure for managing the device inventory.

## Unique Aspects and Complexities:

  One of the most fascinating aspects of this project was its focus on addressing 
  the specific needs of Apple stores, which involved managing 
  a diverse range of Apple products efficiently. 

 a. To achieve this, I utilized a doubly linked list data structure, 
   which offered a balance of efficient insertion, removal, and 
   traversal operations necessary for managing the inventory effectively.

 b. Implementing this data structure posed several challenges, 
   including managing node connections and pointers to ensure data integrity 
   and efficient operations. 

  Additionally, incorporating sorting algorithms like Merge Sort 
  added complexity to the project, requiring careful consideration of 
  algorithmic principles and optimization techniques.

  Overall, this project provided an excellent opportunity to showcase 
  my skills as a software developer by tackling complex problems and 
  developing tailored solutions to meet the unique requirements of 
  the Apple store environment.

## Apple Store - Device Management System

```csharp
  This project implements a device management system for an Apple Store using a 
  doubly linked list data structure. 

  The system allows the store to manage its inventory of electronic devices
   efficiently. 
  Each device in the store, such as iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks, is represented 
  as an object of the Devices<T> class.

## Devices<T> Class
  Represents an electronic device with properties such as Model, Storage, 
  Color, Price, ID, Year, and InStore status.
  Provides a constructor to initialize device properties and methods for validation.
  Implements the ToString() method to convert device information to a string format.

## DoublyLinkedList Class
   Implements a doubly linked list to manage devices.
   Provides methods to add, remove, search for, print, merge sort, insert after, 
   insert before, and clear the list.


## Program Class
a. Contains the Main method to demonstrate the functionality of 
    the implemented doubly linked list.
b. Creates instances of various devices and adds them to the list.
c. Demonstrates inserting a device after and before a specified device.
d. Searches for a device and removes it from the list.
e. Performs merge sort on the list.
f. Prints the list before and after operations, including clearing the list.

```
##  Features: Sorting

### Device Representations

```csharp
  Users can sort the list of devices by various criteria such as Model, Color, 
  Year, Price, and Storage.

  Users can input details of a new devices (Model, Color, Year, Price, and Storage) 
  and add it to the inventory. 

  The new devices is inserted at the correct position based on the sorting criteria. 
  Saving to Store:

  Users can save the current list of Devices to a store file. 
  The system prompts users to enter a file name, 
  and the list is saved with that name in store format. Preloaded Data:

## Device Representation
  i.   Model: Represents the model or type of the device (e.g., iPhone 13, iPad Pro).
  ii.  Storage: Indicates the storage capacity of the device in gigabytes(GB).
  iii. Color: Specifies the color variant of the device.
  iv.  Price: Represents the retail price of the device.
  v.   ID: Unique identifier for each device.
  vi.  Year: Year of release for the device.
  vii. InStore: Boolean flag indicating whether the device is currently 
        available in the store.


 ## Doubly Linked List Implementation

 . Add Device: Enables adding new devices to the inventory.
 . Remove Device: Allows removing devices from the inventory by ID.
 . Search Device: Provides functionality to search for devices by model 
     and optional storage.
 . Insert After/Before: Allows inserting a new device after or 
     before a specified device.
 . Merge Sort: Sorts the devices in the inventory based on their model 
      using merge sort algorithm.
 . Print Inventory: Prints the list of devices in the inventory.

 ## Usage

 1. Adding Devices: Instantiate Devices<T> objects with device details and 
    add them to the inventory using the Add method.

 2. Removing Devices: Remove devices from the inventory by providing their 
    unique ID using the Remove method.

 3. Searching for Devices: Search for devices by model and optional storage 
    using the Search method.

 4. Inserting Devices: Insert new devices after or before a specified device 
    using the Insert After or Insert Before methods.

 4. Sorting Devices: Sort the devices in the inventory based on their model 
    using the MergeSort method.

 5. Clearing Inventory: Clear the entire inventory using the Clear method.

 ## Future Enhancements

 . User Interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with 
     the device management system.
 . Database Integration: Integrate a database to persist device inventory data.

 ## Conclution
 ```csharp
 ## The system outlined in the provided code includes the following components and functionalities:
   A,  Devices<T> Class: Represents electronic devices and provides properties 
          for model, storage, color, price, ID, year, and availability status.  

    It also includes methods for validation and converting device 
        information to string format.

   B,  DoublyLinkedList Class implements a doubly linked list data structure 
         to manage the devices. 
    
    It includes methods for adding, removing, searching, printing, sorting, 
       inserting devices after or before a specified device,and clearing the list.
   
  ## Program Class contains the Main method to demonstrate the functionality 
     of the device management system. 

    It creates instances of various devices, adds them to the list, performs operations 
    such as inserting and removing devices, searches for devices, sorts the list, 
    and prints the inventory.
    
    Usage Instructions provides usage guidelines for adding, removing, searching, 
    inserting, sorting, and clearing the device inventory.
    All in all the project has no external dependencies and is built using C# and .NET framework.

    These components collectively form a system for managing an inventory of electronic
    devices in an Apple Store, facilitating tasks such as adding new devices, 
    removing existing ones, searching for specific models, sorting the inventory, and more.
